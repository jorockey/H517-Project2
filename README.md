# Madden Visualization Dashboard

The goal of this repository is to create a visualization dashboard to investigate player data for the most recent video game based around 
the National Football League, Madden 23. This was made using the popular JavaScript library, D3. The visualizations explore the ratings as well as 
general information of each NFL player in the video game Madden. The files included are the dataset, a main page (index.html), a player specific web page,
and a documentation page. 

This project was completed by Jonah Rockey and Charles May. The dashboard can be viewed in the recent work section at https://jorockey.github.io/.
